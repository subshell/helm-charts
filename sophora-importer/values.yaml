  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # resources:
  #   requests:
  #     memory: "0.4G"
  #     cpu: "0.01"

  #     memory: "2G"
